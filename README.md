# 🕵️‍♂️ Secudoku_Shadow_Audits

Welcome to **Secudoku_Shadow_Audits** a collection of smart contract audit reports created by shadowing real-world DeFi protocols and security assessments. This repository is a part of my continuous journey in mastering **smart contract security** through deep practice and hands-on analysis.

> ⚔️ Learn by auditing. Improve by shadowing. Master through repetition.


## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to sharpen my skills as a **DeFi Smart Contract Auditor** by reverse-engineering the audit process:

- 🧠 Analyze real smart contract codebases  
- 🕵️ Recreate the auditing process independently  
- 📋 Document findings in professional-style audit reports  
- 🛠️ Suggest realistic mitigations and risk assessments



## 📁 What's Inside

This repository contains audit reports in **PDF format**, each representing an independent shadow audit performed on a public or open-source smart contract system.

Each report includes:

- Executive Summary  
- Vulnerability Findings (with severity ratings)  
- Exploitability Analysis  
- Risk Impact Assessment  
- Recommended Fixes  


> Each file is a self-contained shadow audit of a specific protocol or contract set.



## 📌 Learning Goals

- ✅ Simulate real-world audit workflows  
- ✅ Practice spotting subtle and critical vulnerabilities  
- ✅ Improve reporting and professional communication  
- ✅ Build a strong personal portfolio for audit contests and jobs  


## 🧪 Tools & Techniques
